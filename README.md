# Object_Detection_RetinaNet_Checkpoints
In this colab we demonstrate fine tuning of a (TF2 friendly) RetinaNet architecture on very few examples of a novel class after initializing from a pre-trained COCO checkpoint. Training runs in eager mode.  Estimated time to run through this colab (with GPU): &lt; 5 minutes.
